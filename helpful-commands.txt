to start the app:

pre-requisites
    1. Make sure Ganache is running and the ports match code configs

1. open new terminal
    - make sure node version is 10.5.0
    - if not, you need to use nvm to switch versions
    - might need to activate nvm globally with "source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh"
    - then start local web server with "npm run start"
    - browser window should open

2. open another terminal
    - compile code with "truffle compile"
    - migrate contract code with "truffle migrate"

3. open truffle console with "truffle console"
    - opens development console for truffle
    - commands:
        - get contract 
            - "contract = await EthSwap.deployed()"
            - returns undefined but can be fetched by calling "contract"
        - get contract address
            - "add = contract.address"
        - get contract name
            - "name = await contract.name()"
            - returns undefined but can be fetched by calling "name"

4. To exit console
    - > ".exit"

5. To add a new contract to the blockchain
    - truffle migrate --reset

6. Create Token.sol or similar when creating a new token
    - truffle console 
        - get the deployed token with "token = await Token.deployed()"
        - get the token's balance (should return the default that was set in the Token.sol file)
            - ethSwap = await EthSwap.deployed()
            - token = await Token.deployed()
            - balance = await token.balance('address')
            - balance.toString()
